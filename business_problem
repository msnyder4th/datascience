My fiance Cody has always wanted to open a restaurant in Durham, North Carolina. 
This project will allow me to determine if there is demand for a specialty comfort food restaurant in Durham, 
and select the best neighborhood for the restaurant. I will select this neighborhood by identifying the 
concentration of both similar and different restaurants in each area of Durham. 
The ideal location will maximize the distance of this restaurant from similar locations. 
However, it will also minimize the distance to different types of restaurants to ensure that people who 
dine out will come to this area.

To determine whether a restaurant is similar to Cody's Kitchen, I will look for areas where restaurants are concentrated 
together. Once I identify some clusters of neighborhoods, I will compare the style and menu of restaurants in 
Durham's neighborhoods to Cody's Kitchen. We will write a sample menu and add to the dataset for comparison.
